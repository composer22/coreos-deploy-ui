This folder contains a simple UI to access the cluster_map API call with composer22/coreos-deploy

## Configuration

Modify the coreosDeployUI/js/config.js to point to your server and to use your API security token.

## Running

Open index.html in Safari and it should load up a list of machines on your server.

## Filtering the list

Two search boxes are provided:

* Machine Query - filter the machines by a keyword. This is useful for grabbing all the machines with a keyword in the metadata, such as a list of control machines.
* Unit Query - filter the units of a machine by keyword. This will return a list of machines and a sublist of units that contain a particular keyword. This is useful for finding machines that are runnning a service.

## Additional Unit Information

Hovering over the signal icon next to the name of the service will display additional information on the service status.
